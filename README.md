# 简介(Introduction)

《算法导论》是一本非常棒的算法书，对算法的讲解往往深入、详细，让我明白了这些算法解决问题时用到的算法思想、原理以及时间效率等等。然而《算法导论》作为一本讲解算法的经典书籍，避开了使用具体语言去具体实现算法的部分。使得当我在阅读时，常常面临着如何用具体的代码将算法实现的问题。我始终认为只有真正动手实现，才算真正理解了一个算法。

在本项目中，将一边读书，一边托管算法实现的源代码。在这些代码中，或许存在种种不完美的地方，欢迎一起探讨。

_Introduction to Algorithms_ is a great book which explains algorithms in details, it makes me understand their essences easily. But as a classic book about algorithms, it avoids describing with specific programming language, I thus often strive to implement algorithms I have read. Understand is easy, but practice not. So I build this project to include my source code, these code will implement algorithms in C++. I hope what i do can help you. And I welcome you to find mistakes and correct them, we can run this project together.

English is not my native language, so may many mistakes in my words. If you understand what i want to say, and find wrongs in grammer, please help me to correct it. Thank you.
